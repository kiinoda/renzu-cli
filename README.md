# Renzu-CLI

This is a CLI that connects to a renzu installation to issue commands.

Make sure to have a $HOME/.renzurc file that has a URL of a renzu installation on the first line.

If you need it, add the user:pass combo to the full URL. As long as you can do a `curl $URL` and you get valid results, that is OK.
